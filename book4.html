            <p> Animals Make Us Human is, at its simplest, a book about how humans can give the animals in their care the best lives possible. The work focuses on the emotional foundations of behavior and outlines how pet owners, farmers, and more can apply that understanding to dogs, cats, horses, cows, pigs, chickens, wildlife, and zoo animals.
